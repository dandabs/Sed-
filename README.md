# Sed-
A custom-built Discord bot, commissioned by Laatikkoxx + Cortexus of Helsinki Cruises, to verify users' ROBLOX accounts with their Discord accounts.

HC Bot (known internally as Sed√∂) was a commisioned Discord bot for Helsinki Cruises, a fictional ROBLOX cruise company. The bot is hard-coded for this server, and uses Firebase's Hosting, Cloud Functions and Firestore features to link user's Discord accounts to their ROBLOX accounts. The bot also provides account lookup, GEOIP logging and member counts.
The bot has unfortunately since been decommisioned and the ROBLOX API tokens which are present in the source code have been reset. I wrote a blog post about the development and first release of this bot, where I talked about how I felt during the entire process of rolling out my first ever production bot to a ~200 person server.
